# Candy: A Machine Learning Odyssey

Welcome to Candy, a comprehensive suite of open-source machine learning models focusing on innovation and efficiency. Our repository is home to the RWKV Language Model series, spanning from RWKV-LM-5.00 to the latest iterations, including diverse model architectures and applications. Whether you're interested in natural language processing, image generation, or performance benchmarking, Candy provides a gateway to exploring cutting-edge machine learning technologies.

## Highlights

- **RWKV Language Models**: Explore our RWKV-LM series, designed for versatility and performance in various ML tasks.
- **Diverse Applications**: From text generation to image processing, our models cater to a wide array of machine learning applications.
- **Open Source**: Dive into our source code, contribute, and collaborate. Together, we push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Getting Started

To get started with Candy, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/machine-moon/candy.git
cd candy
Installation
Before diving into the models, ensure your environment is set up by following our installation guide:

bash
Copy code
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Exploring the Models
Navigate to our opensrc-models directory to find detailed documentation and usage examples for each model:

bash
Copy code
cd opensrc-models/RWKV-LM-5.00
Usage
Here's a quick start to using one of our RWKV models:

python
Copy code
from RWKV_LM_5_00.src import model

# Initialize and use the model
my_model = model.RWKVModel()
my_model.train(data)
For detailed instructions on training, evaluating, and generating with the models, refer to the README.md files within each model's directory.
